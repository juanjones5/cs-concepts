A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making locally optimal choice at each step, with the intent of reaching the global optimum at the end.

A greedy algorithm is often the right choice for an optimization problem where there’s a natural
set of choices to select from.

It’s often easier to conceptualize a greedy algorithm recursively, and then implement it using
iteration for higher performance.

Even if the greedy approach does not yield an optimum solution, it can give insights into the
optimum algorithm, or serve as a heuristic.
